## ETL Project: Data Scientist Jobs

In our project we took two datasets from Kaggle, “How much do data scientists earn in 2017-2020,” and “HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists” and extracted/transformed the data via Jupyter Notebook, set up our tables with pgAdmin and finally load the data into postgres.
